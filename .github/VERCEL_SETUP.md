# Simplified Vercel Deployment Setup

## 🚀 Why This Approach is Better

Since you're hosting on Vercel, we've simplified the deployment process to leverage Vercel's
excellent GitHub integration rather than fighting against it with custom workflows.

## 🔧 Recommended Vercel Setup

### 1. Enable Automatic Deployments

In your Vercel dashboard:

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**: Link your `perfly` repository
2. **Enable Auto-Deploy**:
   - Production: Deploy from `main` branch
   - Preview: Deploy from all other branches/PRs
3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `bun run build`
   - **Install Command**: `bun install`
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (or leave blank)

### 2. Environment Variables in Vercel

Add these in your Vercel dashboard (Project Settings → Environment Variables):

#### Production Environment

```
DATABASE_URL=your-production-neon-database-url
AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-oauth-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-oauth-client-secret
```

#### Preview Environment

```
# Same variables but with preview/development values
DATABASE_URL=your-preview-neon-database-url
# ... rest of the variables
```

### 3. Neon Database Integration

For the best experience with database branching:

1. **Install Neon Vercel Integration**:
   - Go to Vercel Marketplace → Search "Neon"
   - Install the official Neon integration
   - This will automatically create database branches for preview deployments

2. **Configure Branch Mapping**:
   - Production deployments use main database branch
   - Preview deployments get isolated database branches

## 🎯 What This Gives You

### Automatic Deployments

- ✅ **Push to main** → Automatic production deployment
- ✅ **Open PR** → Automatic preview deployment with isolated database
- ✅ **Update PR** → Preview deployment updates automatically
- ✅ **Close PR** → Preview deployment and database branch cleaned up

### Zero Configuration

- ✅ No need to manage Vercel tokens in GitHub
- ✅ No need to manually handle builds
- ✅ No need to manage environment variables in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Built-in deployment notifications

### Better Developer Experience

- ✅ Instant preview URLs for each PR
- ✅ Isolated database testing
- ✅ Automatic cleanup
- ✅ Built-in monitoring and analytics

## 🔍 What GitHub Actions Still Do

Our simplified workflows now focus on:

- **Code Quality**: Linting, security scanning, performance testing
- **Database Management**: Advanced Neon branching features
- **Monitoring**: Deployment status and notifications
- **Automation**: Dependabot management, PR labeling

## 🚫 What We Removed

We removed the complex deployment logic because Vercel handles it better:

- ❌ Custom build processes (Vercel optimizes this)
- ❌ Manual environment variable management
- ❌ Custom deployment triggers
- ❌ Manual health checks (Vercel provides this)

## 📋 Migration Steps

1. **Set up Vercel GitHub integration** (if not already done)
2. **Move environment variables** from GitHub Secrets to Vercel dashboard
3. **Install Neon Vercel integration** for database branching
4. **Commit the updated GitHub Actions** (already simplified)
5. **Test with a PR** to verify everything works

## 🎉 Result

You now have a modern, maintainable CI/CD pipeline that:

- Leverages each platform's strengths
- Reduces complexity and maintenance overhead
- Provides better developer experience
- Maintains all the automation benefits

The GitHub Actions focus on code quality and advanced features, while Vercel handles what it does
best - deployments and hosting.
